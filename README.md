# Sample Detection of High-Resolution Nikon Images using PyTorch

This repository contains code for labeling samples using image recognition techniques to enable automatic detection of various sample properties. The goal of this code is to differentiate between good and bad samples, serving as an initial attempt. The code utilizes PyTorch framework for efficient and accurate sample detection.

## Usage

To use this code, ensure that you have PyTorch installed on your system. Clone the repository and run the main script. Provide the path to the high-resolution Nikon images as input, and the code will label the samples accordingly. The labeled samples can be further analyzed for automated identification of different sample characteristics.
